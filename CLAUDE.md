### Shared Costs - Timeline View

- Restyle expense list as a visual timeline
- Show settlements as distinct "milestone" markers in the timeline
- Add filtering: by date range, category, settled/unsettled status
- Goal: make it easy to see the full history at a glance while quickly finding specific expenses
